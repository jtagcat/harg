# `hcli`

`hcli` is [@jtagcat](https://github.com/jtagcat]'s wannabe [urfave/cli@v3](https://github.com/urfave/cli) written from the ground up, hoping to become the next major release. It relies on [`harg`](harg/README.md), a feature-complete argument parser.

`hcli` attempts to be as user-friendly as possible, while encouraging more advanced Go patterns and best practices. All of that while staying elegant with standard libraries and newer language syntax.

[#1583](https://github.com/urfave/cli/issues/1583) is loosely tracking this.
